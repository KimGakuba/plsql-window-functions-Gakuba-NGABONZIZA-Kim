# FMCG Sales and Inventory Analysis Project üìä

## Business Context üè™
A mid-sized regional wholesale trader in Rwanda and neighboring districts imports and distributes Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG), including snacks, beverages, cooking oil, and toiletries. The Sales and Supply Chain teams require SKU-level visibility across regions to prevent stockouts and minimize excess inventory, enabling efficient inventory management and optimized distribution.

---

## Data Challenge üìâ
The current sales and inventory data are fragmented:
- Sales data is sourced from daily Point of Sale (POS) feeds and weekly summaries.
- Product codes are inconsistent across datasets.
- Returns and discounts are recorded separately in Excel files.

This fragmentation complicates SKU-level, regional, and time-series comparisons, leading to stockouts of top-selling SKUs in some districts and overstocking of others in warehouses.

---

## Expected Outcome üéØ
The project aims to deliver actionable insights through:
- **Ranked Top SKUs**: Identify top-performing SKUs per region and quarter.
- **Monthly Sales Totals**: Aggregate sales data for each SKU on a monthly basis.
- **Month-over-Month Growth**: Calculate growth trends to highlight demand shifts.
- **Customer Spending Quartiles**: Segment customers based on spending to inform targeted promotions.
- **3-Month Moving Averages**: Smooth out fluctuations to guide replenishment and redistribution strategies.

## Success Criteria üìà

1. **Top 5 Products per Region/Quarter**: Identify the top 5 SKUs by sales volume for each region and quarter using `RANK()` to prioritize high-demand products.
2. **Running Monthly Sales Totals**: Calculate cumulative sales totals for each SKU per month using `SUM() OVER()` to track sales performance over time.
3. **Month-over-Month Growth**: Compute percentage growth in sales for each SKU compared to the previous month using `LAG()` or `LEAD()` to identify demand trends.
4. **Customer Quartiles**: Segment customers into four equal groups based on spending using `NTILE(4)` to enable targeted promotions.
5. **3-Month Moving Averages**: Calculate the average sales over a 3-month rolling window for each SKU using `AVG() OVER()` to smooth demand fluctuations for forecasting.
